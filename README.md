# Linux Scripts


## Software Installation

The softwareInstalls.sh scripts is in place to install the following:

    VS Code
    Docker
    Terminator - with Fish and other terminal additions
    PIP
    Gnome-Tweaks

It also sets up my scripts directory and clones this linuxSetupScripts down to it.

## Fish and Theme Config

The configuration for these two components are handled together as they both require some prerequisites:

    open a terminal and start fish with the "fish" command
    open gnome-tweaks either through the GUI or with the "gnome-tweaks" command
